    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. 
        It helps determine how <em>efficient</em> an algorithm is when handling large datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. 
        An algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) means that its memory usage increases linearly with the input size.
